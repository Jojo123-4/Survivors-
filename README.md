# Survivors-
Iâ€™ve been drugged and raped in the past by someone I really trusted. I try criminally twice. Then go public. Hoping to encourage other victims. At least let them know they are not alone. Without making you cry. In a way we can speak freely. But end with some hope, humour, and fighting!!
